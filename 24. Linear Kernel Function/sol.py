# Linear Kernel Function
# Write a Python function kernel_function that computes the linear kernel between two input vectors x1 and x2. The linear kernel is defined as the dot product (inner product) of two vectors.

# Example:
# Input:
# import numpy as np

# x1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
# x2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# result = kernel_function(x1, x2)
# print(result)
# Output:
# 32
# Reasoning:
# The linear kernel between x1 and x2 is computed as:1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6 = 32


# Solution:
import numpy as np

def kernel_function(x1, x2):
    return np.inner(x1, x2)

# Test Case:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    x1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    x2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
    
    result = kernel_function(x1, x2)
    print(result)  # Output: 32
