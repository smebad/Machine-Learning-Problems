# Implement Recall Metric in Binary Classification
# Task: Implement Recall in Binary Classification
# Your task is to implement the recall metric in a binary classification setting. Recall is a performance measure that evaluates how effectively a machine learning model identifies positive instances from all the actual positive cases in a dataset.

# You need to write a function recall(y_true, y_pred) that calculates the recall metric. The function should accept two inputs:

# y_true: A list of true binary labels (0 or 1) for the dataset.
# y_pred: A list of predicted binary labels (0 or 1) from the model.
# Your function should return the recall value as a float. If the denominator (TP + FN) is zero, return 0.0 to avoid division by zero.

# Example:
# Input:
# import numpy as np

# y_true = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1])
# y_pred = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1])

# print(recall(y_true, y_pred))
# Output:
# 0.75
# Reasoning:
# There are 4 actual positive instances in y_true. The model correctly identified 3 of them, giving a recall of 0.75.


# Solution:
import numpy as np

def recall(y_true, y_pred):
    tp = np.sum((y_true == 1) & (y_pred == 1))
    fn = np.sum((y_true == 1) & (y_pred == 0))
    
    if tp + fn == 0:
        return 0.0
    
    return tp / (tp + fn)

# Test Case:
y_true = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1])
y_pred = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1])
print(recall(y_true, y_pred))  # Output: 0.75
